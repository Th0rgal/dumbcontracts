name: Property Coverage Work
about: Improve contract property verification
title: '[Property Coverage] '
labels: proof, lean, help-wanted
---

## Goal
<What property coverage needs improvement>

## Motivation
- **Properties affected**: <which properties blocked>
- **Limitation**: <what prevents proving today>
- **Impact**: <how many contracts affected>

## Solution
<Infrastructure addition - types, lemmas, modeling>

```lean
<Example code if relevant>
```

## Blocked Properties
- [ ] <Property 1>
- [ ] <Property 2>

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Infrastructure in `DumbContracts/Proofs/Stdlib/`
- [ ] At least one property proven using new infrastructure
- [ ] docs/ROADMAP.md updated
- [ ] CI passes

**Effort**: <hours/weeks>
