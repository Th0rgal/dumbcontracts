# AUDIT

## Architecture & trust boundaries

Components and flow:
1. `Verity/*` EDSL contracts and logical specs (`Prop`).
2. `Compiler/CompilationModel.lean` validates and lowers `CompilationModel` to IR.
3. `Compiler/Codegen.lean` lowers IR to Yul AST.
4. `Compiler/Yul/PrettyPrint.lean` renders Yul text.
5. `solc` compiles Yul to EVM bytecode.
6. AST types (`Verity/AST.lean`) and denotation proofs (`Verity/Denote.lean`) are retained as proof artifacts; the AST compiler backend (`--ast`) has been removed.

Trust changes:
1. Lean proofs stop at generated Yul; `solc` correctness is trusted.
2. Selector hashing includes a documented keccak axiom (see `AXIOMS.md`).
3. Linked external Yul libraries are trusted TCB code.
4. CI scripts consume repo/workspace files as untrusted input and must validate format before use.

## Security model

Threat assumptions:
1. Adversary may submit malformed source/contracts/docs/artifacts through PRs.
2. CI runners execute checks on attacker-controlled branch contents.
3. Deployers use the proof-backed CompilationModel path (CompilationModel).

Access control and checks:
1. Solidity runtime access control is contract-specific and tested in Foundry suites under `test/`.
2. Build/verification gate is deny-by-default: CI fails on invariant drift (selectors, storage layout, docs/proof counts, property coverage, warning regressions).
3. `scripts/workflow_jobs.py` centralizes top-level `jobs:` parsing (quoted and unquoted keys) for workflow-sync checkers, so cross-job boundary extraction is explicit and shared.
4. `scripts/check_lean_warning_regression.py` validates baseline schema/invariants and fails on mismatch. Uses `type(value) is not int` to reject booleans, raises `ValueError` on malformed UTF-8 log input, and validates `by_file`/`by_message` counter fields strictly.
5. `scripts/check_doc_counts.py` uses `_expect_int` with `type(value) is not int` to reject booleans in integer metric fields.
6. `scripts/check_verify_artifact_sync.py` uses step-level `with:` block parsing that is key-order independent.
7. `scripts/check_verify_checks_docs_sync.py` uses `extract_run_commands_from_job_body` which handles both single-line and multiline `run: |` commands.
8. `scripts/check_verify_foundry_patched_sync.py` uses `extract_literal_from_mapping_blocks` to scope `DIFFTEST_*` extraction to `env:` blocks only.
9. `scripts/check_verify_foundry_job_sync.py` uses `extract_literal_from_mapping_blocks` to scope `FOUNDRY_PROFILE`/`DIFFTEST_*` extraction to `env:` blocks only.
10. `scripts/check_verify_foundry_shard_sync.py` uses `extract_literal_from_mapping_blocks` to scope `DIFFTEST_SHARD_COUNT`/`DIFFTEST_RANDOM_SEED` extraction to `env:` blocks only.
11. `scripts/check_verify_foundry_gas_calibration_sync.py` uses step-scoped parsing for `FOUNDRY_PROFILE` and artifact names.
12. `scripts/check_verify_multiseed_sync.py` scopes seed extraction to `strategy.matrix.seed`.
13. `scripts/check_verify_paths_sync.py` scopes path-filter extraction to `jobs.changes`.
14. `scripts/check_interop_matrix_sync.py` detects duplicate normalized feature rows with explicit error reporting.
15. `scripts/check_builtin_list_sync.py` strips Lean comments before `def` extraction, preventing comment-decoy bypass.
16. `scripts/check_solc_pin.py` collects all `SOLC_*` matches via `finditer` and fails on conflicting values across occurrences.
17. `scripts/check_yul_builtin_boundary.py` uses `scrub_lean_code` to strip comments and string literals before boundary checks.
18. `scripts/check_mapping_slot_boundary.py` uses `scrub_lean_code` to strip comments and string literals before boundary checks.
19. `scripts/check_evmyullean_capability_boundary.py` detects non-literal builtin dispatch patterns and reports them as fail-closed diagnostics.
20. `Compiler/CompilationModel.lean` recursive validation walkers for unsafe logical call-like detection, array-element usage detection, return/revert reachability, and bind-name collection are totalized (`def` + explicit `termination_by`), reducing reliance on `partial def` in the active compilation path.
21. `Compiler/CompilationModel.lean` additionally totalizes dynamic-parameter scope checks, statement read/write analysis, and statement-list validator walkers (`validateStmtParamReferences`, `validateReturnShapesInStmt`, `validateNoRuntimeReturnsInConstructorStmt`, `validateCustomErrorArgShapesInStmt`) with explicit structural recursion.
22. `Compiler/CompilationModel.lean` further totalizes all Expr/Stmt validation walkers: scoped-identifier validation (`validateScopedExprIdentifiers`, `validateScopedStmtIdentifiers`, `validateScopedStmtListIdentifiers`), interop validation (`validateInteropExpr`, `validateInteropStmt`), internal-call-shape validation (`validateInternalCallShapesInExpr`, `validateInternalCallShapesInStmt`), external-call-target validation (`validateExternalCallTargetsInExpr`, `validateExternalCallTargetsInStmt`), and event-argument-shape validation (`validateEventArgShapesInStmt`) with explicit structural recursion in mutual blocks.
23. `Verity/Macro/Translate.lean` supports explicit `getMappingUint`/`setMappingUint` forms for `Uint256 -> Uint256` storage fields with fail-closed typed diagnostics (`Address` mappings must use `getMapping`/`setMapping`).
24. `Verity/Macro/Bridge.lean` emits per-function `_semantic_preservation` theorems (Issue #998) stating real semantic equivalence: EDSL execution ≡ interpretSpec(spec, ...) for all inputs. On success, asserts interpretSpec succeeds and all declared storage slots agree; on revert, asserts interpretSpec fails. Proof is `sorry` — discharging eliminates `interpretSpec` from the TCB. The macro auto-generates `edslToSpecStorage` conversion from the contract's storage field declarations.
25. `Compiler/Proofs/EndToEnd.lean` composes Layer 2 (CompilationModel→IR) and Layer 3 (IR→Yul) preservation theorems into a single end-to-end result. All 5 universal pure arithmetic bridge theorems proven (add/sub/mul via `Nat.add_mod`/`Nat.mul_mod`/`omega`; div/mod via `Fin.div`/`Fin.mod` unfolding + in-range preconditions).
26. `Verity/Proofs/Stdlib/PrimitiveBridge.lean` proves per-primitive EDSL↔compiled-Yul correctness lemmas (getStorage↔sload, setStorage↔sstore, getStorageAddr, setStorageAddr, getMapping/setMapping, add/sub/mul/div/mod↔builtins, lt/gt/eq↔comparisons, require↔iszero+revert, msgSender↔caller, Uint256/Address encoding, calldataload, Contract.run, mixed-type multi-slot encoding).
27. `Compiler/Proofs/SemanticBridge.lean` states the target EDSL≡compiled-IR theorems for SimpleStorage (store, retrieve), Counter (increment, decrement, getCount), Owned (getOwner, transferOwnership), SafeCounter (increment, decrement, getCount), and OwnedCounter (getCount, getOwner, increment, decrement, transferOwnership) and attempts full discharge via direct `simp` unfolding of both EDSL and IR execution — no `sorry` in these proofs. Owned demonstrates Address-typed storage encoding; SafeCounter demonstrates success/revert case-split for checked arithmetic; OwnedCounter demonstrates mixed-type multi-slot encoding and access control composition. Additionally, composed EDSL→IR→Yul end-to-end proofs for SimpleStorage (store, retrieve) and Counter (increment) chain the EDSL≡IR proofs with Layer 3 preservation to yield the full trust chain without `interpretSpec`.

Crypto choices:
1. Function selectors use keccak256 (Ethereum ABI standard interoperability requirement).
2. Mapping slot addressing follows standard keccak-based EVM storage scheme.
3. No custom cryptography is introduced in this repo.

## Design decisions

1. Single compiler front-end (`CompilationModel`/`CompilationModel`); AST backend was removed after migration completed.
2. Use many small explicit CI check scripts rather than one opaque mega-check; each guard maps to one invariant and one failure reason.
3. Keep warning-regression baseline as checked JSON artifact for deterministic CI behavior; validate schema strictly to avoid silent acceptance of malformed data.
4. Prefer generated artifacts and sync checks over handwritten counts/metadata to reduce review-time ambiguity.

## Known risks

1. `solc` is trusted and outside Lean proof scope.
2. AST denotation proofs are retained as proof artifacts but are not part of the active compilation path.
3. Linked external Yul libraries remain trusted dependencies and must be audited separately.
4. Gas bounds are engineering checks, not semantic security proofs.

## External dependencies

1. `solc`: trusted compiler from Yul to EVM bytecode.
2. Foundry (`forge`/`anvil` tooling): trusted test harness/runtime for Solidity tests.
3. Lean toolchain (`lake`, Lean compiler): trusted proof checker and build runtime.
4. Python 3 standard library scripts: trusted CI execution environment; scripts validate untrusted file inputs where used.

## Attack surface

External input entry points:
1. CLI/compiler inputs and contract sources (`Verity/*`, `Compiler/*`).
2. Foundry test inputs, calldata/value fuzzing, and FFI-enabled differential/property test harnesses (`test/*`).
3. CI/workflow-consumed files and generated artifacts (`artifacts/*.json`, docs tables, manifests, gas reports, logs).
4. Newly hardened boundary: `artifacts/lean_warning_baseline.json` consumed by `scripts/check_lean_warning_regression.py`.

Primary review focus:
1. Selector/ABI drift (`Compiler/Selector.lean`, `Compiler/Selectors.lean`, `scripts/check_selectors.py`).
2. Storage slot/type drift across layers (`scripts/check_storage_layout.py`).
3. Cross-path output drift and Yul compileability (`scripts/check_yul_compiles.py`).
4. Contract access-control/property behavior (`test/Property*.t.sol`, `test/Differential*.t.sol`).
