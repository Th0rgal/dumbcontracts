# Dumb Contracts Research

This repository contains research notes, sketches, and prototypes for the "Ethereum Dumb Contracts" idea.

## Goals

- Explore a DSL for specifying contract behavior as auditable rules and invariants.
- Investigate compilation targets (Solidity subset / EVM opcodes) from specs.
- Evaluate proof-generation workflows that link specs to implementations.
- Identify constraints, threat models, and implementation tradeoffs.

## Repository Layout

- `docs/` - Research notes and working documents.
- `research/` - Structured explorations, literature notes, and comparisons.
- `specs/` - DSL drafts and example specs.

## Getting Started

See `docs/research-log.md` for the running log and `docs/agenda.md` for the current research agenda.
