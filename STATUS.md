## Current Focus

- Keep the POCs minimal and auditable while validating real-world invariants.
- Maintain reliable unit tests for each "goal scenario" and run them in CI.

## In Progress

- Expand the tooling landscape with up-to-date references and gaps.
- Iterate on a state-diff validator pattern that matches the DSL intent.

## Completed

- Repository scaffolding and initial draft capture.
- DSL-to-Solidity skeleton for a token transfer spec.
- POC contracts and tests for two goal scenarios (token transfer, health factor).

## Next

- Add a tiny DSL -> verifier compilation path for Scenario A.
- Explore off-chain proof obligations for quantified invariants.
- Prototype a minimal transition verifier interface for state diffs.
