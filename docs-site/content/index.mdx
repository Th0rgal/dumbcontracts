# Dumb Contracts

Auditable smart contract specs: rules first, implementations second. Lean specs + proofs compile toward Yul/EVM.

## Why This Exists

Smart contracts are too smart for their own good. We want contracts where the rules are the code, and the implementation must match the rules by construction.

## Core Idea

- Write a **dumb contract spec** (invariants + ensures).
- Generate or verify an implementation against the spec.
- Keep the spec short enough to audit in minutes.

## Where To Start

- **[Status](/status)** for current focus and progress.
- **[Roadmap](/roadmap)** for near-term and longer-term milestones.
- **[Formal Approach](/formal-approach)** for the Lean/Yul direction.
- **[Research Log](/research-log)** for a timestamped change history.

## Repository Map

- `research/lean_only_proto/` is the canonical Lean prototype.
- `docs/` is the short-form documentation set.
- `STATUS.md` tracks current focus and next steps.

## Quick Start

```bash
cd /workspaces/mission-a7986e44/dumbcontracts/research/lean_only_proto
PATH=/opt/lean-4.27.0/bin:$PATH lake build
./scripts/end_to_end.sh
```
