# Roadmap

**North Star**
Lean specs + proofs -> verified EVM.

**Now**
- Keep `research/lean_only_proto/` canonical.
- Yul/ASM/bytecode are first-class.
- Keep surface area small.

**Next**
- Prove arithmetic + storage correctness.
- ABI return memory model.
- Prove dispatcher + return path.

**Later**
- Reverts, branches, loops.
- Storage layout rules + proofs.
