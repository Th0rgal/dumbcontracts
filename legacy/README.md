# Legacy Archive

This directory contains archived research artifacts from earlier phases of the project.
The current focus is the Lean-only prototype in `research/lean_only_proto`.

What's kept here:
- `docs/` older notes and explorations.
- `foundry/` archived Solidity/Foundry specs and harnesses (trimmed of build outputs).
- `research/` prior POCs (DSL, SMT, spec-IR sketches, leanMultisig bridge).
 

None of this is part of the active pipeline; it's retained for reference only.
