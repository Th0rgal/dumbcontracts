# Foundry Legacy Artifacts

This folder contains archived Solidity specs, harnesses, and examples from the earlier
DSL/SMT phase. Build outputs, caches, and dependencies were removed to keep the repo
lightweight. The active research track no longer depends on this content.

Kept:
- `specs/` DSL spec sources used to generate harnesses.
- `src/` Solidity implementations and harnesses.
- `test/` Foundry tests for the legacy harnesses.
- `foundry.toml` for reference.
